1. We can only work with unsigned integers right now in move(means no negatives allowed right now)

2. Move supports six unsigned integer types: u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, and u256. 

3. Range: 0 to 2^(n-1)

4. Operations: +, -, *, /, |, &, !, %, >>, <<, >=, <=, ==, !=, >, <, 

5. Cast:

(x as u8)
(y as u16)
(873u16 as u32)
(2u8 as u64)
(1 + 3 as u128)
(4/2 + 12345 as u256)
