Scripts are executable entrypoints similar to a main function in a conventional language. 

A script typically calls functions of a published module that perform updates to global storage. 

Scripts are ephemeral code snippets that are not published in global storage.

A Move source file (or compilation unit) may contain multiple modules and scripts. 

However, publishing a module or executing a script are separate VM operations.

Syntax:

```
script {
    <use>*
    <constants>*
    fun <identifier><[type parameters: constraint]*>([identifier: type]*) <function_body>
}
```
