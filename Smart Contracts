SC are not a conventional program. We don't use them to write compilers or operating systems.

They really do just 3 things:

1. Define new types of assets
2. Define some policies for reading, writing and transferring these assets: ownership
3. Check control policies: Who is allowed to touch/access these assets

So, what we really need in the SCs to be safe are:

1. Language support that gives us safe abstractions for the custom assets, ownership and access control
2. Strong isolation: writing safe open-source code. This code we know will directly interact with the attacker's code as we can't hide our SC due to it's trasnparent policy behind a firewall.

This is why SCs are not available in conventional languages

Fundamental blocks of a SC:

1. Assets
2. Ownership
