Details:

  1. Based on Rust programming language, Facebook created a new programming language called Move to write smart contracts (to transfer assets, while providing security and protection against attacks on those assets )
  2. Aim to build move: flexible, secure, sandboxed, and formally verified programming
  3. Still an evolving language
  4. First use case: Diem blockchain
  5. Then got adopted by Aptos, Sui and Starcoin blockchains.
  6. A Turing complete language that supports loops.
  7. Interpreted language.
  8. Statically typed language: Have to declare the type of each variable.
