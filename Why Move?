Smart Contract safety is very important.

100M+ hacks are a routine!!

Hence safer smart contract languages, advanced testing, analysis and verification tools are very important.

In other SC languages:

1. We cannot pass an asset as an argument to a function
2. We cannot return an asset from a function
3. We cannot store an asset in a data structure
4. We cannot let a callee function temporarily borrow an asset
5. We cannot declare an asset in Contract 1 and let it be used by Contract 2
6. We cannot take an asset outside the contract that created it (it is trapped forever in the hash table defining the contract)

We can do all these in Move

Also, the 2 fundamental blocks of a SC(assets and ownership), there is no vocabulary to define them in other languages. But move has.
